Restaurant Reviews App
Prepare for this project with Accessible Web Applications (COMING SOON).
Requirements
You must build a restaurant reviews application with a focus on accessibility. The application must include restaurant names, a photograph, address and operating hours for each restaurant along with reviews, including the name of the reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating system, and comments. The application must include an application header, a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants. When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.
Review the evaluation rubric early and often.


Project Submission
You will develop a restaurant review application with a focus on accessibility. You will remotely access JSON files containing restaurant information (including name, a photograph, address, cuisine type and operating hours) as well as JSON files containing review information for each restaurant (name of reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating and comments). The reviews application must include an application header, and a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants (by cuisine, by location, etc). When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.
Supporting Course: Web Accessibility coming May 2016.
Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
Submission
Once you've completed your project, return to your Udacity Homepage and use the Submit Project button to submit a GitHub repository or .zip archive.
